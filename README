During the development of this assignment, we decided to split the code into 2 .cpp files, one driver file for the main function and a threads file for managing the 4 threads. Inside the threads file there is a thread creation/initialization function, a thread running function, and a function for creating the card text for printing. We learned a lot about thread creation/management and how IPC mechanisms like semaphore can be helpful in accomplishing said thread management. We also learned about the benefits of a standard like POSIX which was helpful when we needed to use a sleep function (usleep) and find the manual pages for pthread functions.
